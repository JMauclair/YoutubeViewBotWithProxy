Selenium 4 has a number of changes aimed at improving the security posture
of running your own infrastructure. The ability to communicate to a Selenium
Server (whether it is acting as a Standalone or Grid) is discussed in `Secure
Communication` and restricting Grid Nodes to only those you trust is covered
in `Node Registration.`

1. Secure Communication
=======================

Selenium Grid by default communicates over HTTP. This is fine for a lot
of use cases, especially if everything is contained within the firewall
and against test sites with testing data. However, if your server is
exposed to the Internet or is being used in environments with production
data (or that which has PII) then you should secure it.

Standalone

In order to run the server using HTTPS instead of HTTP you need to start
it with the `--https-private-key` and `--https-certificate` flags to
provide it the certificate and private key (as a PKCS8 file).

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       hub \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem
```

Distributed

Alternatively, if you are starting things individually you would also
specify https when telling where to find things.

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       sessions \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem
```

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       distributor \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem \
       -s https://sessions.grid.com:5556
```

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       router \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem \
       -s https://sessions.grid.com:5556 \
       -d https://distributor.grid.com:5553 \
```

Certificates

The Selenium Grid will not operate with self-signed certificates, as a
result you will need to have some provisioned to you from a Certificate
Authority of some sort. For experimentation purposes you can use MiniCA to
create and sign your certificates.

```
  minica --domains sessions.grid.com,distributor.grid.com,router.grid.com
```

This will create minica.pem and minica.key in the current directory as well as
cert.pem and key.pem in a directory `sessions.grid.com` which will have both
distributor.grid.com and router.grid.com as alternative names. Because Selenium
Grid requires the key to be in PKCS8, you have to convert it.

```
  openssl pkcs8 \
    -in sessions.grid.com/key.pem \
    -topk8 \
    -out sessions.grid.com/key.pkcs8 \
    -nocrypt
```

And since we are using a non-standard CA, we have to teach Java about it. To do that
you add it to the cacert truststore which is by default, $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts

```
  sudo keytool \
      -import \
      -file /path/to/minica.pem \
      -alias minica \
      -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts \
      -storepass changeit \
      -cacerts
```

2. Node Registration
====================

Selenium Grid distributes script execution to worker nodes. Those nodes self-register
with the Grid Distributor process when they start and the Distributor trusts that
they should be getting work. This is fine in highly secured networks where everything
is trusted, but aside from that you really want to make sure that the node is one you
control and not a rouge node. In order to do this, you start the Distributor, Router and
Node servers with the new `--registration-secret` command-line argument.

Using the same examples as above, they become the following with this additional layer
of security.

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       distributor \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem \
       -s https://sessions.grid.com:5556 \
       --registration-secret cheese \
```

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       router \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem \
       -s https://sessions.grid.com:5556 \
       -d https://distributor.grid.com:5553 \
       --registration-secret cheese
```

```
  java -jar selenium.jar \
       node \
       --https-private-key /path/to/key.pkcs8 \
       --https-certificate /path/to/cert.pem \
       --detect-drivers \
       --registration-secret cheese
```
Note: If the registration-secret from the Node to the Distributor (or Router) is
incorrect, there is nothing to indicate that returned to the Node. There is an ERROR
level log entry produced on the servers. You should be monitoring the logs for that
and raise alarms as deemed appropriate.
