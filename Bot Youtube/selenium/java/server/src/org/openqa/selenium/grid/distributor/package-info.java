/**
 * The {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.Distributor} is responsible
 * for assigning new calls to Create Session to a
 * {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.Node}. It's possible that the first
 * attempt to create a session fails for any number of reasons, and so a
 * well-behaved implementation will continue trying additional nodes until
 * either a session starts or nothing is successful.
 * <p>
 * To complicate matters, local ends may send a session request that is one of
 * two different dialects (presumably in the future there may be more. *sigh*)
 * and care must be taken to ensure that dialacts match, or that a converter
 * of some sort is added. The Node may be the part of the system responsible
 * for adding this converter.
